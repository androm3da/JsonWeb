   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

JsonWeb
=======
JsonWeb is a package for encoding and decoding your python classes to and from JSON. I found 
myself writing a lot of JSON services and I got sick of writing the same boiler plate code over and over again.
   
   
Main documentation
-------------------

To get the best understanding of JsonWeb you should read the
documentation in order. As each section builds a little bit on the last.
